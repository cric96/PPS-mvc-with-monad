# Model View Controller meets Monad <!-- fit -->

> # *It is all about composition*

# Goals
- show an end-to-end **functional** application
- leverage some well-consolidated functional libraries
- understand limitations (if any) and the improvements

# Target Application
## **Tic Tac Toe**

# OOP Design
## Everything is an object
Clean interface, state incapsulated, side effect as methods call.

Let's try to build an *old-fashion* application :smile:

---
<!-- header : OOP Design -->
## Model

```
/* two players (X, O)  */
enum Player {
    X, O, None;
}
/* a board 3x3 */
interface TicTacToe {
    Player get(int X, int Y);
    TicTacToe (or void??) update(int x, int y, Player p);
    boolean isOver;
    Player getTurn;
}
```

---
## View
```
//a l√† view model?
interface ViewBoard {
    List<String> getRow(int row);
    List<List<String>> getAllBoard();
}

interface View extends ClickCellSource {
    void render(ViewBoard board);
    void winner(String player);
}

```
---
## Put some design pattern :smile:

```
public interface ClickCellSource {
    void attach(Observer observer);
    interface Observer {
        void notify(int X, int Y);
    }
}
```
---
## Controller
```
public interface Game extends ClickCellSource.Observer {
    void start();
}

public class TicTacToeGame implements Game {
    private final TicTacToe ticTacToe;
    private final TicTacToeView ticTacToeView;

    public static TicTacToeGame playWith(
        final TicTacToe ticTacToe, 
        final TicTacToeView ticTacToeView) {...}
    ....

```
---
## Putting all togheter
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    final TicTacToeView view = SwingView.createAndShow(800, 600);
    final TicTacToe model = TicTacToeFactory.startX();
    final Game game = TicTacToeGame.playWith(model, view);
    game.start();
}
```
---
## Clean enogh right?
### What do you think?

Try to rethink using "functional" abstractions 

(Monads? Functions? Algebric Data Type?)

---
# Libraries

- [Cats](): provides abstractions for functional programming in the Scala programming language
- [Monix](): high-performance Scala / Scala.js library for composing **asynchronous**, **event-based** programs

---
<!-- header : Monix abstraction -->
# **Task**
> Task represents a specification for a possibly lazy or asynchronous computation, which when executed will produce an A as a result, along with possible side-effects.
---
## What does it refer you to?
```
trait Task[+A] {
    final def flatMap[B](f: A => Task[B]): Task[B] = ...
    final def map[B](f : A => B): Task[B] = ...
    //some interesting extesions
    def memoize: Task[A] = ...
}
object Task {
    def pure[A](a : A) : Task[A]
    def defer[A](a : Task[A]) : Task[A]
}
```
---
## [A Little taste](https://scalafiddle.io/sf/C4Qon6a/1)
```
val scheduler = monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global

def someComputation(data : Long) : Task[Long] = 
    Task.pure(data * 1000)

def log(value : String) : Task[Unit] = Task { println(value) }

val main = for {
  data <- someComputation(4)
  _ <- log(s"computations ends with value $data")
} yield (data)

main.runToFuture(scheduler)
```

# **Observable**
>  a data type for modelling and processing asynchronous and reactive streaming of events with non-blocking back-pressure.

We use it to implement [Functional Reactive Programming](http://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_Reactive_Programming)

Out of this talk, If you are interested [Conal Elliot](http://conal.net/) makes a lot of materials about this topics.
